# Movie_rating_System

The Movie Rating System is a C++ project designed to allow users to rate and review movies across various genres. This system provides a user-friendly interface for signing up, logging in, browsing movies by genre, and submitting ratings. It also dynamically calculates and displays average ratings for each movie category.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication Users can securely sign up with a username and password, ensuring only registered users can access the system. Upon login, users can rate movies and view their rating history.
   
2. Genre-based Movie Display: The system categorizes movies into genres such as Comedy, Action, Romantic, and Horror. Users can choose a genre to browse and rate movies within that category.

3. Dynamic Rating Calculation: Ratings for each movie are stored and updated dynamically. The system maintains arrays to store ratings and counts the number of ratings for each movie, allowing it to calculate average ratings in real time.

4. File Handling: The system utilizes file handling to read and display movie names from external text files. This allows for easy management and expansion of the movie database without modifying the source code.

How to Use
1. Sign Up/Login: Users can sign up with a username and password or log in if they already have an account.
   
2. Browse Movies Choose a genre to view a list of movies available for rating within that category.
   
3. Rate Movies Select a movie from the list and rate it on a scale of 1-10. The system validates user input to ensure ratings are within the valid range.

4. View Ratings Check the average ratings for each movie category to see how they stack up against each other.

Future Enhancements:
1. User Profiles: Implement user profiles to track individual users' rating history and preferences.
   
2. Recommendation System: Integrate a recommendation engine to suggest movies based on user preferences and past ratings.
   
3. Improved Interface: Enhance the user interface with graphical elements and a more intuitive design for better user experience.
